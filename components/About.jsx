          The manual library management system poses numerous challenges due to
          its heavy reliance on paperwork and manual calculation. These
          traditional methods lead to inconsistencies and inaccuracies in data
          maintenance, making it a time-consuming process that causes
          significant inconvenience to library staff. Moreover, the systemâ€™s
          limitations make it extremely difficult to locate a specific book or
          to edit the data of existing books.

          and advanced search options. This system is designed with the needs of
          different users in mind, catering to specific majors and research
          requirements.
